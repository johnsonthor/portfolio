        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Thor Johnson and I am currently a  second-year student at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. I plan to graduate from this fine university in 4 years with a degree in Integrated Strategic Communications, with a minor in Multimedia Communications. So far, in my three completed semesters, I have earned a spot on the prestigious Dean's List for two consecutive semesters. This is in recognition of students who have been succeeding academically, and I have been able to do that with a cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.75. In addition to earning good grades in my classes, I have been able to learn many practical skills that I feel will aide me in my future career. </p>
        <p>The software that I have become familiar with is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adobe InDesign</li>
            <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
            <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
            <li>Adobe Premiere Pro</li>
            <li>Microsoft Office Suite</li>
            <li>Microsoft Visual Studio Code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This list may not be exhaustive, but I am confident in my abilities as a fast learner. I have gained proficiency in each of these respective softwares in just under a semester at school.</p>
        <p>In terms of work experience, I have held various positions at multiple businesses. Coming from a small town of 1,300 people, there were not many jobs available to teenagers growing up, but I made the most of the opportunities that were provided to me, as I have been working steadily when not in school since age Eleven, when I started working lawncare and landscaping jobs for several different houses in my neighborhood. This small one-man business is something that I have grown to the point where I now have a comfortable 7 lawns that I attend regularly to in the summers.</p>
        <p>With my other remaining time, I have also had experience working for my town's local Italian Restaurant, where for three years I worked wherever they needed me. I started as a cook, but quickly rose to the position of delivery driver in just a few weeks. From there, I also gained experience working as a server, when needed, and in my final months I became trained to be a part-time manager. The interpersonal skills and patience that I learned in my time at this restaurant were invaluable, and I feel have adequately prepared me for a career in the Communications field.</p>
        <p>My most recent summer job came this past summer, when I began working at a local Canoe Outfitter, again in my hometown. Here, I gained experience advertising for the business and organizing various promotions and events to help boost business. I also served as a shuttle driver, front desk worker, handled trip scheduling, and other general maintenance work for the business.</p>
